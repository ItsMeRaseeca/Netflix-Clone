This is a Netflix landing page clone built using HTML and CSS. It includes sections like the main hero banner, feature highlights with images and videos, a simple FAQ section, and a footer, all styled to look as close as possible to the real site. It is responsive and was made to practice front-end skills, creating a clean, structured UI.
